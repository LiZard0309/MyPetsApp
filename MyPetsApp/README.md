# MyPetsApp

Supported languages: English, German

An app to store and show data of your pets. 
You can upload data of your pet as well as a photo and an animal sound. For each pet you can pick a vet and medication - the medication and vet data is also stored in the app, so you can access your vet's contact details easily. The app also shows your pet's necessary medication as well as the medication's recommended intake time.
The app comes with preloaded pet data, but you can easily delete this data. But don't worry about accidentially deleting data - the app will ask you to confirm this action via an alert message.  
To create an appealing User Interface the buttons as well as the Navigation Links are animated.
